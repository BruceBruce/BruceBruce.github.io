First off, let me introduce myself.  My name is Bruce Willis and I a 39 year old U.S. Army Veteran and single father of three boys.  Currently I am employed as a "state contract worker".  The reason I am deciding to learn coding is the fact that I am partially disabled due to the wear and tear of the Army.  That and where my current job is physically demanding at times and I wanted to switch from using my body to using my mind.  When I was young I used to dabble with computers but it was mostly hardware or OS.  I used to maintain all the family computers whether it was updating or upgrading them.  I was always the one my parents called when there was a virus or malware on their computer.  So with all that being said I wanted to dive in and look behind the screen to see "the code less travelled" to open my eyes to what is really going on.  In the first two weeks of school I have learned more than I could have thought I would.  From defining a varible to calling a method to sorting an array by index and building hashes.
